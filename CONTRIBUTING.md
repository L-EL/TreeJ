## Environment details: how to compile ?
TreeJ can be compiled with any Fiji or ImageJ: go to Plugins>Macro, it will open an editor where you can open the java file and run the code with the Run button under the editor.

If you don't have a javac linked to your Fiji, you can call Fiji from a terminal this way :
~/link/to/imageJ/ImageJ-linux64 --java-home /link/to/an/openjdk/folder --default-gc

Keep in mind that ImageJ/Fiji uses java 8, you can't compile with higher versions.
